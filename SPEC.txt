
All should be done in Waves.html, or any other new .html file.
Waves.html contains a sample of what is done so far.

Spec 1: Waves: 4 of them, not 2. Need to keep variables in original script 
(so that I can control of color, wave properties/speed/distance from each other, etc)

Spec 2: Blue in background of waves needs to have a "static" filter which is highly transparent 
(think left 4 dead 'grain' filter. Static has already been made, just has to be overlayed on the waves part)

Spec 3: 4 parallel white lines moving left to right across black section of upper screen 
(updating 10Hz / 10x per second, from  a .CSV file or equivalent).

One cycle: 
	1st line using 1st dataset is drawn from left to right in 30seconds and then cleared.
	2nd line using 2nd dataset is drawn from left to right in 30seconds and then cleared.
	3rd line using 3rd dataset is drawn from left to right in 30seconds and then cleared.
	4th line using 4th dataset is drawn from left to right in 30seconds and then cleared.

Spec 4: Blue in background waves needs to transition from BLUE x1 to BLUE x 2 at 30 
second intervals (or whatever variable I change in the code)
